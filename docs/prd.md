# IoT Smart Environment Monitoring Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Enable real-time monitoring of temperature and humidity in critical environments
- Provide instant alerts via Telegram when environmental conditions exceed safe thresholds  
- Create a comprehensive dashboard for historical data visualization and trend analysis
- Demonstrate practical IoT implementation using affordable ESP32 and DHT22 hardware
- Reduce manual monitoring effort while preventing costly environmental damage

### Background Context

Modern environments require precise temperature and humidity control for optimal operation and asset protection. Whether it's maintaining comfortable office conditions, preserving valuable museum artifacts, or ensuring laboratory equipment operates within specifications, manual monitoring is inefficient and unreliable. 

This project addresses the critical gap between environmental monitoring needs and available solutions by creating an intelligent IoT system. Using ESP32 microcontrollers with DHT22 sensors, the system provides continuous monitoring with real-time alerts via Telegram Bot integration and comprehensive data visualization through ThingsBoard dashboards. This approach transforms reactive manual checking into proactive automated monitoring, enabling immediate response to environmental changes before damage occurs.
