# Epic 1: IoT Sensor Integration

## Epic Overview
Implement IoT sensor data collection and processing system using ESP32 microcontrollers to gather environmental data and transmit it to the central processing system.

## Business Value
Enable real-time environmental monitoring for the hackathon project, providing foundational data collection capabilities that will feed into the PKC (Personal Knowledge Container) and Telegram Bot systems.

## Epic Goals
- Set up ESP32-based sensor nodes for data collection
- Implement reliable data transmission protocols
- Create data processing and storage mechanisms
- Establish monitoring and alerting for sensor health

## Stories in this Epic

### Story 1.1: ESP32 Sensor Node Setup
**As a** system administrator,
**I want** to configure ESP32 microcontrollers with environmental sensors,
**so that** I can collect temperature, humidity, and air quality data from multiple locations.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. ESP32 boards are configured with WiFi connectivity
2. Temperature and humidity sensors (DHT22) are connected and functional
3. Air quality sensor (MQ-135) is integrated and calibrated
4. Sensor readings are displayed on serial monitor for debugging
5. Basic error handling is implemented for sensor failures

### Story 1.2: Data Transmission Protocol
**As a** IoT developer,
**I want** to implement MQTT protocol for sensor data transmission,
**so that** sensor data can be reliably sent to the central processing system.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. MQTT client is configured on ESP32
2. Sensor data is formatted as JSON messages
3. Data is published to appropriate MQTT topics
4. Connection retry logic is implemented for network failures
5. Message delivery confirmation is tracked

### Story 1.3: Data Processing Service
**As a** backend developer,
**I want** to create a service that receives and processes IoT sensor data,
**so that** the data can be stored and made available for analysis.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. MQTT subscriber service is implemented
2. Incoming sensor data is validated and parsed
3. Data is stored in a time-series database
4. Data aggregation functions are available (hourly, daily averages)
5. API endpoints are created for data retrieval

## Technical Requirements
- ESP32 microcontrollers
- DHT22 temperature/humidity sensors
- MQ-135 air quality sensors
- MQTT broker (Mosquitto)
- Time-series database (InfluxDB or similar)
- WiFi network connectivity

## Dependencies
- Hardware procurement and setup
- Network infrastructure
- Database setup

## Definition of Done
- All sensors are collecting data reliably
- Data transmission is stable with <1% packet loss
- Data processing service handles 100+ sensor readings per minute
- System monitoring and alerting is operational
- Documentation is complete for setup and maintenance
