# Story 1.1: ESP32 Sensor Node Setup

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** system administrator,
**I want** to configure ESP32 microcontrollers with environmental sensors,
**so that** I can collect temperature, humidity, and air quality data from multiple locations.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ESP32 boards are configured with WiFi connectivity
2. Temperature and humidity sensors (DHT22) are connected and functional
3. Air quality sensor (MQ-135) is integrated and calibrated
4. Sensor readings are displayed on serial monitor for debugging
5. Basic error handling is implemented for sensor failures
